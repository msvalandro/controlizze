# Creating Test Doubles

Unlike most classical or functional languages, JavaScript under test might
depend on many sorts of things: plain objects, instantiable constructor
functions, ES2015 classes, or regular old functions. As a result, any good test
double library needs to provide terse and convenient ways to create fake
versions of all of these things.

The examples below will walk through the different ways to create new test
doubles. Each example assumes you've aliased `testdouble` to `td`.

This document discusses all the ways to manually create test doubles, but keep
in mind that in practice many developers will lean on `td.replace`, which
performs this duty on your behalf. Read more about `td.replace` on [its doc
page](7-replacing-dependencies.md).

## td.function

**Note that `td.func` is available as an alias of `td.function`.**

To create a fake function with test double, we use the `function` function. At its simplest, invoking:

``` javascript
var bark = td.function() // '[test double (unnamed)]'
```

`bark` is now a test double function, meaning it can be configured to stub a particular response with `td.when`, its invocations can be verified with `td.verify`, and its current state can be introspected with `td.explain`.

To provide yourself with better messages, we recommend assigning a name to the function; this is particularly important whenever a test will have more than one double in use at a time:

``` javascript
var woof = td.function('.woof') // test double for ".woof"
```

### Creating a test double function from a real function

If you're replacing an actual function with a test double, you can also pass it
to `td.function` and all of its properties will be copied over. If any of its
properties are functions, those functions will be replaced with test double
functions as well.

```js
function meow () { throw 'unimplemented' }
meow.volume = 'loud'
meow.stop = function () {}

var fakeMeow = td.function(meow) // test double for "meow"
fakeMeow.volume // 'loud'
fakeMeow.stop // test double for "meow.stop"
```

This can be handy when you're replacing a dependency that is a function but also
has significant properties defined (imagine a module that exports a function as
well as a synchronous version exposed via a `sync` property).

## td.object

Creating a one-off function is really easy, but often our subjects will depend
on objects with functions as properties. Because we don't want to encourage the
use of [partial
mocks](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Partial-Mock),
test double offers a number of ways to create objects whose function properties
have all been replaced with fake functions.

Because there's a number of ways to create objects of test doubles, it's
important that we provide some guidance on which tool to use when. Because we
use test doubles to practice outside-in test-driven development, most of the
fake objects we use represent code *that doesn't exist yet*. As a result, there
are two styles you might take:

* Pass `td.object()` a **plain JavaScript object** which contains functions as
  properties. testdouble.js will mirror either of these by replacing all the
  functions it detects. If you practice this style, it means part of your
  test-driven workflow will require you to define those types in your production
  code as you write your tests. This is a great way to take advantage of the TDD
  workflow to implement a skeleton of your object graph as you work,
  all-the-while keeping the contracts between your subject and its dependencies
  explicit enough to catch failures when you change the contract between the
  [subject](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Subject) and
  its dependencies (i.e. if you change the name of a dependency's function, the
  test double function would disappear and break the caller's test).
* Pass `td.object()` an **array of function names** or (if using a runtime that
  implements [ES2015
  Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy))
  a **name for the object**. This style makes prototyping interactions easier
  because it doesn't require the author to define production-scope functions of
  dependencies while authoring the caller's test. Conversely, it runs the risk
  of "fantasy green" tests that continue passing even if a dependency's
  functions change in the future

No style is right or wrong, as they both have trade-offs (full disclosure: when
practicing TDD in a greenfield application, the present author usually prefers
the former style). However, we would encourage teams to pick one style and apply
it consistently to reduce the cognitive load of keeping straight the expected
behavior of tests when depended-on objects change.

### object(someObjectWithFunctions)

Suppose you have an object with some functions as properties (and perhaps some non-function properties). If passed to `td.object()`, testdouble.js will do a deep copy of the object and replace of any functions found on the object while and return it.

So, given:

``` javascript
var fish = {
  eat: function(){}
  swim: function(){}
  details: {
    age: 10,
    name: 'goldie'
  }
}
```

Then you could fake the fish out with:

``` javascript
var fish = td.object(fish)

fish.eat // a test double function named '.eat'
fish.details.age // still `10`
```

### object(functionNames)

If you pass `td.object` an array of strings, it'll return a plain object with those properties set as named test double functions.

``` javascript
var cat = td.object(['meow', 'purr'])

cat.meow // a test double function named 'meow'
```

### object([objectName])

If passed either a string name or no arguments at all, `td.object` will return an [ES2015 Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object designed to forward any property access as if it were a test double function. By using `Proxy`, testdouble.js is able to intercept calls to properties that don't exist, immediately create a new test double function, and invoke that function for use in either stubbing or verifying behavior.

``` javascript
var parrot = td.object('Parrot')

parrot.squawk // a test double function named 'Parrot#squawk'
```

### Excluding certain methods from Proxy-based test doubles

Sometimes, your subject code will check to see if a property is defined, which
may make a bit of code unreachable when a dynamic test double responds to every
single accessed property.

For example, if you have this code:

``` javascript
function leftovers(walrus) {
  if(!walrus.eat) {
    return 'cheese';
  }
}
```

You could create a test double walrus that can reach the cheese with this:

``` javascript
walrus = td.object('Walrus', {excludeMethods: ['eat']});

leftovers(walrus) // 'cheese'
```

By default, `excludeMethods` is set to `['then']`, so that test libraries like
Mocha don't mistake every test double object for a Promise (which would cause the
test suite to time out)


## td.constructor()

Test Double can also create artificial constructor functions. This method can be
passed either a constructor (or ES `class`) or an array of function names and
will return a constructor whose functions are all replaced by test doubles.

### constructor(someConstructorFunction)

Suppose you have a constructor function:

``` javascript
function Dog(){}
Dog.prototype.bark = function(){}
Dog.woof = function(){}
```

To create a test double of the constructor that has prototypal function `bark`
and "static" function `woof`, simply pass `Dog` to `td.constructor()`

``` javascript
var FakeDog = td.constructor(Dog)

FakeDog.prototype.bark // a test double function named 'Dog#bark'
FakeDog.woof // a test double function named 'Dog.woof'
```

When `FakeDog` is instantiated, any stubbings (or verifications) set up by the
test on the `FakeDog.prototype` will also translate to the instances, for
instance:

```javascript
td.when(FakeDog.prototype.bark()).thenReturn('YIP')

var dog = new FakeDog()

dog.bark() // 'YIP
```

### constructor(arrayOfFunctionNames)

If you want a fake constructable thing to have a certain set of instance methods
defined on it, testdouble.js can also create one from an array of function
names.

```javascript
var FakeCat = td.constructor(['meow', 'scratch'])

FakeCat.prototype.meow // a test double function named '#meow'
FakeCat.prototype.scratch // a test double function named '#scratch'
```

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a plethora of ways to create test doubles with testdouble.js, each designed to handle a different style of organizing JavaScript code. We recommend landing on one consistent style (e.g. each module as one function) for each project, which in turn would encourage one consistent style of creating test doubles. This API is written to be flexible for a number of potential contexts across objects, but it has come at the cost of a large enough surface area that if any project were to make ample use of all or most of the above invocation styles, it would confuse readers.
