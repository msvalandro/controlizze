# Stubbing behavior

In test double parlance, to "stub" a method or function is to configure it to return a particular response for  a given set of inputs. When used as a noun or referred to as a "stubbing", a person could be referring to the configured test double itself or the act of returning an artificial response. When the code that you're testing depends on other units of code to do its job, the (hopefully, vast) majority of those units are invoked with a set of inputs to return some useful output. As a result, when practicing an outside-in test-driven-development workflow, being able to specify that type of interaction in a readable and specific way is very important.

In testdouble.js, we stub behavior with the `td.when()` function. In this chapter, we'll discuss simple stubbings, matching inexact arguments, and advanced configuration options that testdouble.js supports.

All of the examples in this document presume the reader has aliased `testdouble` to `td`.

## td.when()

The basic structure of a stubbing configuration follows:

``` javascript
var quack = td.function('quack')

td.when(quack()).thenReturn('some return value')

quack() // 'some return value'
```

As JavaScript APIs go, this should strike readers as unusual, but it's an intentional design. Note that inside the invocation operator `()` of `td.when` that the entire call to the test double is, for lack of a better term, *rehearsed*. The goal is to demonstrate an invocation of the test double function just as the test expects the subject to invoke the dependency it representsâ€”to a level of precision desired by the situation.

> If the above is still bothering you, note that the implementation of testdouble.js doesn't care what is "passed" into `td.when()`'s first argument position. In fact, what the library will actually do is simply pop the most recent call to _any test double_ off its global call stack whenever `when()` is invoked and presume that it was a "rehearsal" invocation for the next stubbing.

The `when()` function returns an object containing the function `thenReturn`, which is used to specify the value the test double should return if it's invoked as specified in the `when()` call. There are also a `thenDo` and `thenThrow` response type which are described below.

## Simple, precise argument stubbing

When practicing outside-in TDD, unit tests are typically completely isolated. As a result, in most cases it's fair to expect that the test will be able to (and will desire to) specify the exact interactions the subject should have with each of its dependencies. The stubbing API exposed by testdouble.js assumes that the "rehearsed" invocation in a stubbing is made with deeply-equivalents arguments to what the subject is expected to use. (Granted, that is not always desired; later, we'll show how to use so-called "argument matchers" as a means to loosen that specification.)

### No-argument stubbings

The easiest invocation to stub is a no-arg invocation. In fact, you've already seen an example!

``` javascript
var quack = td.function('quack')

td.when(quack()).thenReturn('some return value')

quack() // 'some return value'
quack('anything else at all') // undefined
```

### n-argument stubbings

You can also specify arbitrarily many arguments. Given the example above, you might say:

``` javascript
td.when(quack('soft')).thenReturn('quack')
td.when(quack('soft', 2)).thenReturn('quack quack')
td.when(quack('soft', 2, 'hard', 3)).thenReturn('quack quack QUACK QUACK QUACK')

quack('soft') // 'quack'
quack('soft', 2) // 'quack quack'
quack('soft', 2, 'hard', 3) // 'quack quack QUACK QUACK QUACK'
```

As you can see above, a test double function can be stubbed multiple times for different sets of arguments.

> It's worth noting that stubbing rules are "last-in-wins", meaning that if multiple stubbings are satisfied by an invocation of the test double, the one configured latest is the one that's returned. This is almost certainly the behavior you would want in a test, because you could start with a very generic stubbing at the top of a test, and override it later from a point in the test that represents a more specific context.

### One-liner stubbings

Sometimes, when all you need from a test double is a one-off stubbing, you'll want to express both the creation of the test double and that stubbing as tersely as possible. You can do this, since `thenReturn` will return the test double instance. That means that:

``` javascript
var woof = td.function()
td.when(woof()).thenReturn('bark')
```

Is equivalent to this:

``` javascript
var woof = td.when(td.function()()).thenReturn('bark')
```

### Stubbing sequential return values

Sometimes your subject should invoke a dependency multiple times in the same way. For instance perhaps your subject wants to invoke a `randomSound()` function to return `'quack'`, then `'honk'`, then `'moo'`. This can be configured by passing additional arguments to `thenReturn()`, like so:

``` javascript
var randomSound = td.function('randomSound')

td.when(randomSound()).thenReturn('quack', 'honk', 'moo')

randomSound() // 'quack'
randomSound() // 'honk'
randomSound() // 'moo'
randomSound() // 'moo'
```

As you can see, any additional invocations will continue to return the final stubbing in the sequence.

### Loosening stubbings with argument matchers

#### A note on unconditional stubbing

Note that these stubbings will only return their stubbed value if called exactly as they're demonstrated when `td.when()` is invoked. That means, given the examples above, that invoking things like:

``` javascript
quack('hi')
quack([1,2,3],4)
quack('anything','at','all')
```

Will each return `undefined`. This differs from the default stubbings one might create with Jasmine or Sinon.js, but it's by design. When your code calls another function, the arguments it passes _probably matter_. As a result, testdouble.js defaults to assuming that the inputs passed to stubbed test doubles are necessary.

For instance, if the stubbing were unconditional, we might pat ourselves on the back for writing this test:

``` javascript
function sitInTraffic(horn){
  return horn() + '!'
}

var horn = td.function()
td.when(horn()).thenReturn('beep')
assert.equal('beep!', sitInTraffic(horn))
```

But if our stubbings were unconditional, that means the test would still pass even if we changed the implementation as follows:

``` javascript
function sitInTraffic(horn){
  return horn('no really do not honk') + '!'
}
```

Which would probably not be our intention. As a result, testdouble.js only loosens its rules about whether a stub is said to be "satisfied" when you explicitly indicate that it should.

#### What are argument matchers?

An "argument matcher" is a special function which, when passed to a test double function during its `td.when()` "rehearsal" invocation, can modify the default behavior of whether a particular argument will match a given invocation. (That default behavior, recall, is to expect each actual argument to be deeply equivalent to the rehearsed argument.)

Out of the box, testdouble.js ships with a handful of matchers. They are:

#### td.matchers.anything()

When passed `td.matchers.anything()`, any invocation of that test double function will ignore that parameter when determining whether an invocation satisfies the stubbing. For example:

``` javascript
var bark = td.function()

td.when(bark(td.matchers.anything())).thenReturn('woof')

bark(1) // 'woof'
bark('lol') // 'woof'
bark() // undefined
bark(2, 'other stuff') // undefined
```

#### td.matchers.isA()

When passed `td.matchers.isA(someType)`, then invocations of the test double function will satisfy the stubbing when the actual type matches what is passed to `isA`. For example:

``` javascript
var eatBiscuit = td.function()

td.when(eatBiscuit(td.matchers.isA(Number))).thenReturn('yum')

eatBiscuit(5) // 'yum'
eatBiscuit('stuff') // undefined
eatBiscuit() // undefined
```

While `Number` is shown above, it will work for any built-in type (e.g. `String` or `Date`) or any named custom prototypal constructors defined by the user.

#### td.matchers.contains()

When passed `td.matchers.contains()`, then a stubbed argument can be loosened to be satisfied by any invocations that simply contain the portion of the argument. This works for several types, including strings, arrays, and objects.

##### Strings

Using `contains` on a  string argument is pretty straightforward:

``` javascript
var yell = td.function()

td.when(yell(td.matchers.contains('ARGH'))).thenReturn('AYE')

yell('ARGH') // 'AYE'
yell('ARGHHHHHHH') // 'AYE'
yell('ARG') // undefined
```

###### Regular Expressions

Using `contains` with regular expressions on string arguments is also supported:

``` javascript
var yell = td.function()

td.when(yell(td.matchers.contains(/ARGH$/i))).thenReturn('AYE')

yell('ARGH') // 'AYE'
yell('ARGHHHHHHH') // 'undefined'
yell('argh') // 'AYE'
yell('ARG') // undefined
```

##### Arrays

Here's how to use `contains` with an array argument:

``` javascript
var jellyBeans = td.function()

td.when(jellyBeans(td.matchers.contains('popcorn', 'apple'))).thenReturn('yum')

jellyBeans(['grape', 'popcorn', 'strawberry', 'apple']) // 'yum'
jellyBeans(['grape', 'popcorn', 'strawberry']) // undefined

```

##### Objects

You can also use `contains` to specify only part of an object. This is especially
useul when a large object is being passed around, but only part of it matters to
the interaction being tested.

``` javascript
var brew = td.function()

td.when(brew(td.matchers.contains({ingredient: 'beans'}))).thenReturn('coffee')

brew({ingredient: 'beans', temperature: 'hot'}) // 'coffee'
brew({ingredient: 'hops', temperature: 'hot'}) // undefined
```

Better yet, the `contains` matcher is capable of doing deep searches of sparse
properties:

``` javascript
var brew = td.function()

td.when(brew(td.matchers.contains({container: {size: 'S'}}))).thenReturn('small coffee')

brew({ingredient: 'beans', container: { type: 'cup', size: 'S'}}) // 'small coffee'
brew({ingredient: 'beans', container: { type: 'cup', size: 'L'}}) // undefined
brew({}) // undefined
```

#### td.matchers.argThat()

If the other built-in matchers don't serve your needs and you don't want to roll
your own custom matcher, you can use `argThat()` to pass a truth test function
to determine whether an invocation will satisfy the stubbing.

``` javascript
var pet = td.function()

td.when(pet(td.matchers.argThat(function(animals){ return animals.length > 2 }))).thenReturn('goood')

pet(['cat', 'dog', 'horse']) // 'goood'
pet(['cat', 'dog']) // undefined
pet({length: 81}) // 'goood'
```

If you find yourself needing a matcher that isn't defined above, you can
[define your own custom matchers](8-custom-matchers.md) as well.

Keep in mind that any side effects in an `argThat` predicate function will be
invoked when you set up subsequent stubbings, so plan accordingly to ensure that
they are free of test-altering side effects and will behave appropriately for
whatever input they might be passed by both the test and the subject.

#### td.matchers.not()

When you only care that a test double function _isn't_ passed a certain value,
you can use the `not` matcher:

``` js
var didSucceed = td.function()

didSucceed(true)

td.verify(didSucceed(td.matchers.not(false)))
```

### Stubbing callback APIs

Callback APIs are very common, especially in Node.js, and for terseness and
convenience sake, testdouble.js provides conveniences for stubbing functions
that expect a callback argument.

Suppose you'd like to test-drive a function like this:

``` js
function deleteFiles(pattern, glob, rm) {
  glob(pattern, function(er, files) {
    files.forEach(function(file){
      rm(file)
    })
  })
}
```

You could write a test for `deleteFiles` using `td.when`'s `thenCallback` API:

``` js
var glob = td.function()
var rm = td.function()
td.when(glob('some/pattern/**')).thenCallback(null, ['foo', 'bar'])

deleteFiles('some/pattern/**', glob, rm)

td.verify(rm('foo'))
td.verify(rm('bar'))
```

The above is very terse and gets the job done, but it makes some assumptions that
may not apply to every situation. The above assumes:

* that `glob`'s callback argument is the last argument users will pass to it
(which is a pretty common convention)
* that the return value of `glob` is not significant

Note that **all callbacks are invoked synchronously**, which makes unit testing
functions which are only incidentally asynchronous much simpler.

#### Callback APIs with a callback argument at an arbitrary position

Take the same example above, but suppose that `glob`'s arguments were reversed:
the callback was in the first position and the string pattern was passed second.
This can be done by placing a reference to `td.callback` as a marker for its
argument position to the stubbing:

``` js
td.when(glob(td.callback, 'some/pattern/**')).thenCallback(null, ['foo', 'bar'])
```

#### Callback APIs with meaningful return values

Suppose in the above example that `glob`'s return value was also significant,
in that case we can trade terseness for some added explicitness by treating
`td.callback` as an argument matcher and chaining `td.when` with `thenReturn`
as we might normally do:

``` js
td.when(glob('some/pattern/**', td.callback(null, ['foo', 'bar']))).thenReturn(8)
```

Now, calls that satisfy the above stubbing on `glob` will both invoke the callback
with the parameters provided to `td.callback` and also return `8`.

#### Callback APIs with multiple callback arguments

Some APIs have multiple callback functions, all of which need to be invoked to
properly exercise the subject. Suppose your code depends on
`doWork(onStart, onEnd)`, and both callback arguments should be invoked in a
single test, you could:

``` js
var doWork = td.function()
td.when(doWork(td.callback(null, 42), td.callback(null, 58))).thenReturn()

var percent = 0
doWork(function(er, progress) {
  percent += progress
}, function(er, progress) {
  percent += progress
})

assert.equal(percent, 100)
```

Remember, not every test needs to invoke every callback; it's fine to specify
them separately, especially if it would lead to more focused tests. You could
break up the above into two tests by matching the other function argument with
an `isA(Function)` matcher:

``` js
td.when(doWork(td.callback(null, 42), td.matchers.isA(Function))).thenReturn()
```

### Stub exceptions with thenThrow

In addition to `thenReturn`, you can stub a method to throw an exception when
invoked in a certain way.

``` js
var save = td.function()
td.when(save('bob')).thenThrow(new Error('Name taken'))

save('bob') // throws error 'Name taken'
```

### Stub promises with thenResolve and thenReject

As a little touch of shorthand, you can stub a method to return an immediately
resolved or rejected promise.

To stub a resolved Promise, use `thenResolve`:

``` js
var fetch = td.function()
td.when(fetch('/user')).thenResolve('Jane')

fetch('/user').then(function (value) {
  console.log(value) // prints "Jane"
})
```

To stub a rejected Promise, use `thenReject`:

``` js
var fetch = td.function()
td.when(fetch('/user')).thenReject('Joe')

fetch('/user').catch(function (value) {
  console.log(value) // prints "Joe"
})
```

Note that while the testdouble.js API is itself entirely synchronous, most
Promise implementations will ensure that `then` is invoked on a subsequent tick
of the event loop, which will in turn require any tests that use Promise objects
to run asynchronously.

#### Using non-native Promise libraries

If your runtime doesn't support native promises, or if your application depends
on a particular promise library, you'll first need to point testdouble.js to it.
This only needs to be done once (perhaps in a global test helper).

``` js
td.config({
  promiseConstructor: require('bluebird')
})
```

For more on configuration, read [the appendix on td.config](C-configuration.md).

### Stub side effects with thenDo

This shouldn't be needed very frequently, but when a depended-on method needs to
have a side effect, you can stub that side effect by passing a function to
`thenDo` in a stubbing.

For instance, if you were testing a function like this:

``` js
function numbers(upTo, append) {
  for(var i=0; i < upTo; i++) {
    append(i)
  }
}
```

You could design a test to ensure the provided `append` function is invoked as
you'd expect by simulating the side effect in the test using `thenDo`:

``` js
var items = []
var append = td.function()
td.when(append(td.matchers.anything())).thenDo(function(x){ items.push(x) })

numbers(5, append)

assert.deepEqual(items, [0,1,2,3,4])
```

Note that the above verification could also be done with `td.verify`, but might
be more straightforward in some situations.

### Configuring stubbings

So far, we've seen `td.when()` only invoked with one argument, but it sports a
second configuration parameter as well, with a handful of options.

Keep in mind that these additional options are made available because they each
have occassional genuine value, but they ought to only be needed sparingly. If
you find yourself reaching for any of these options on a very frequent basis,
we recommend you pause and ask what about the design of your code is encouraging
the perceived need of that option.

#### ignoreExtraArgs

Sometimes, a subject will call a dependency with arbitrarily many arguments, but
for the purpose of a test, only the earlier arguments are significant to the
interaction being considered "correct". Once in a great while, none of the
arguments passed to a depended-on function matter at all. In either of these
cases, you can use the `ignoreExtraArgs` configuration property when stubbing
with `when()`

Here's an example:

``` javascript
logger = td.function()

td.when(logger("Outcomes are:"), {ignoreExtraArgs: true}).thenReturn('loggy')

logger("Outcomes are:") // 'loggy'
logger("Outcomes are:", "stuff") // 'loggy'
logger("Outcomes are:", "stuff", "that", "keeps", "going") // 'loggy'
logger("Outcomes are not:", "stuff") // undefined
```

Or, in the case where _literally none of the arguments matter_:

``` javascript
whatever = td.function()

td.when(whatever(), {ignoreExtraArgs: true}).thenReturn('yesss')

whatever() // 'yesss'
whatever(1,2,3,4,5) // 'yesss'
```

#### times

Sometimes you want to ensure that a function will only return a particular value
at most `n` times.

Note that for simple cases, one could use
[sequential stubbing](#stubbing-sequential-return-values) like
`td.when(...).thenReturn('foo','foo',undefined)` to return `'foo'` at most two
times.

For more complex cases, the `times` property can be configured to effectively
disable a stubbing after it's been satisfied `n` times. This is especially
useful in cases where a generic stubbing is configured first, but a more specific
stubbing is configured later and you want to fall back on the earlier generic
stubbing later. If this sounds incredibly obtuse and convoluted, you'd be right
to think so.

Here's an example of using the `times` property for a complex stubbing
arrangement:

``` javascript
var nextToken = td.function()

td.when(nextToken(td.matchers.isA(Number))).thenReturn("foo")
td.when(nextToken(3), {times: 2}).thenReturn("bar")

nextToken(3) // 'bar'
nextToken(5) // 'foo'
nextToken(3) // 'bar'
nextToken(3) // 'foo'
```

#### defer

[Note: you probably don't need this option. Using it everywhere smells of overly
defensive specifications.]

By default, callback stubbings (whether configured via the `td.callback` matcher
or by invoking `thenCallback`) are invoked synchronously. Since testdouble.js is
designed for isolated unit tests, this is usually what you want, because
comprehending and troubleshooting synchronous test scripts will always be much
simpler than asynchronous ones. However, in the event that you want to ensure
the subject isn't inadvertently relying on this synchronous execution of
callbacks, you can ensure those callbacks are scheduled to a later execution
stack by setting the `defer` option to `true`.

Take this example of an erroneously passing test:

```js
// Subject under test
function printBalance (id, fetchBalance, print) {
  var balance;
  fetchBalance(id, function (er, amount) {
    balance = amount
  })
  print('Your balance is ' + balance)
}

// Test body
var fetchBalance = td.function('.fetchBalance')
var print = td.function('.print')
td.when(fetchBalance(42)).thenCallback(null, 1337)

printBalance(42, fetchBalance, print)

td.verify(print('Your balance is 1337'))
```

The above passes, but suppose that in practice `fetchBalance` is going to
invoke the callback asynchronouslyâ€”if that's the case, then this passing test
will be lying to us! To guard against this category of test smells, you can set
the `defer` option when stubbing the async dependency, like so:

```
td.when(fetchBalance(42), {defer: true}).thenCallback(null, 1337)
```

Now the test above will failâ€”shiny! Keep in mind that you'll have to make the
overall test asynchronous (e.g. a `done` callback in Mocha/Jasmine) when using
the `defer` option.

[Note: while this option is also supported for the Promise stubbings
`thenResolve` and `thenReject`, all standard Promise implementations will
already ensure your event handlers will fire asynchronously on a later call
stack.]

#### delay

[Note: you _really_ probably don't need this. You might need `defer` above, but
only reach for this `delay` option when your subject's behavior depends on the
order in which various async operations are completed.]

When using `td.callback`, `thenCallback`, `thenResolve`, or `thenReject`, you
can use the `delay` option to wait a set number of milliseconds before the
operation completes.

Here's a quick and silly example of what this option entails:

```js
var fetch td.function('.fetch')
td.when(fetch('/A'), {delay: 20}).thenCallback(null, 1)
td.when(fetch('/B'), {delay: 10}).thenCallback(null, 2)
td.when(fetch('/C'), {delay: 5}).thenResolve(3)

fetch('/A', function (er, result) {}) // will be invoked 3rd
fetch('/B', function (er, result) {}) // will be invoked 2nd
fetch('/C').then(function (result) {}) // will be invoked 1st
```

## Congratulations!

And that's about all there is to say about stubbing. Great news, because the
other major feature of any test double libraryâ€”verifying an invocation took
placeâ€”has an API that was carefully-designed to be completely symmetrical! Read
on about [verifying interactions with `verify()`](6-verifying-invocations.md),
and rest easy knowing that you already know exactly how to do it.
