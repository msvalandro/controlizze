# Getting Started

This is the example code that's paired with our documentation on getting
started with testdouble.js. (TODO: Add a link!)

## Running the examples:

In one shell:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

In another shell:

```
$ npm run test:dev
```

## Perusing the code

You can find all the tests in `spec/` and the source in `app/js`.
